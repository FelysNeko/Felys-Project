# Felys

Calulation interpreter, also as an application of postfix notatioin (reverse polish noatation)

Some sample codes that can be understood by interpreter are in "workplace.ely". You can use command "./felys workplace.ely" to see the ouput, and make sure you add execution permission to "felys".
