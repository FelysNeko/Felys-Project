# Felys-Interpreter 2.0

This is the branch for version 2.0, which is still under development. In this version, more data type will be supported such as string, rational number, and iterables, and it will be dynamic typing. Plus, all the datatype are simulated by string, so that it allows you to store infinitly long numbers or string, as long as your computer does not run out of memory. Again, this project is way beyond my capability, so there is no guarantee that I can finish this project like version 1.1.
